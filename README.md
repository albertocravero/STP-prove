I'm implementing the 2D RBF. Open loop works fine, i tried also to use the actual amplitude as input action and maybe it could work. In the open, with the right constants and constraint on actions and amplitude, it's possible
to get an RBF that simulate the flapping motion

For the closed i'm implementing it, but maybe the similarity will be lost beacuse of the saddle points (which are in the middle wrt max and min). Tomorrow i have an exam, later we can schedule a call.
